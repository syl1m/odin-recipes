        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Braised Pork over rice</strong> is another popular Taiwanese dish.  This dish uses braised pork belly that is cut into small pieces or even minced.  The pork belly is braised for an hour or more to create its signature tender texture.</p>

        <p>This is a traditional homestyle Taiwanese comfort food that goes great over rice or noodles. My family often makes this in large batches that will last for a couple days.  It's a great leftover food and reheats well.</p>
